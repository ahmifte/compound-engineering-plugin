# cross-model-adversarial-review.sh
#
# Runs the adversarial review through a DIFFERENT model family (the "peer") in a
# separate, read-only process, and writes its findings as JSON into the run dir.
# The peer gets the same canonical adversarial brief the in-process reviewer uses
# (references/personas/adversarial-reviewer.md) so it is genuinely "the adversarial
# persona, on a different model."
#
# Usage:  cross-model-adversarial-review.sh <peer: codex|claude> <base-ref> <run-dir>
#   <peer>     codex  -> use Codex (when the host is Claude or Cursor)
#              claude -> use Claude (when the host is Codex)
#   <base-ref> the diff base (e.g. a merge-base SHA or branch); the peer reviews
#              only `git diff <base-ref>` in the current repository
#   <run-dir>  an existing dir; output is written to <run-dir>/adversarial-<peer>.json
#
# Self-locates its sibling reference files via BASH_SOURCE (NOT the CWD, which is
# the user's project on every host), and derives the repo root from git. The agent
# only has to pass the three values above.
#
# NON-BLOCKING BY DESIGN: every failure logs to stderr and exits 0 without an output
# file. The cross-model pass is additive and must never fail the review; the caller
# detects success purely by the presence of <run-dir>/adversarial-<peer>.json.
